# Server Deployment Setup

This repository includes a GitHub Action workflow that automatically deploys the Hugo site to your server when code is pushed to the master branch.

1. **SERVER_HOST**: The IP address or hostname of your server
2. **SERVER_USER**: The username for SSH access to your server  
3. **SERVER_PASSWORD**: The password for SSH access to your server

## Setting up GitHub Secrets

## What the Deployment Does

The deployment workflow will:

1. SSH into your server using the provided credentials
2. Navigate to the `jubilant-octo-rotary-phone` directory
3. Switch to the master branch (`git checkout master`)
4. Pull the latest changes (`git pull origin master`)
5. Remove any `draft: true` lines from posts in `content/posts/*.md`
