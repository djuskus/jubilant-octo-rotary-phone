# Moses at Sinai

Most of my morning routine consisted of reading the word, mainly because I felt very physically lazy. ultimately its much more important than working out so that works out.

I read Exodus 21-25, which is a lot about the law, and establishing more specific laws about slaves, sinning against others and how that should be prosecuted and punished. Also measurements of things to be built includkng the ark of the covenant. There were some things that struck me in the practicality of the law, and i Guess the ark of the covenant is a interesting enough subject (although maybe not hearing it's physical description.

i got a lot more from going back to reflect on the ten commandments. This [Bema Episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68i4POQzjbnZRINStnH947?si=01CecTVFTAqWhLZRMBK9Zw) on the preamble to Sinai and the commandments was good for learning several things i missed about the tests of the people on the way to Sinai
