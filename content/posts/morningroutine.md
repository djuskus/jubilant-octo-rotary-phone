# Morning routine

## Purpose

Why do it?

The morning is the most intentional time of the day. There is something that is just magic about this time before things have really began to just be in motion and working on things, and what you choose to fill this time with is a very meaningful statement that will carry through the whole day. Scheduling is key to living an intentional and examined life, and scheduling the morning is the pinnacle of that.

## My personal priorities in the morning
* God
    * Being in touch with the highest authority, before the mind has a chance to get it's own (crazy) ideas is wise. It's good to read the Word and just fill one's self with God's thoughts. I also sometimes experience a literal feeling of connectedness at the crown of my head, like I am truly OPEN to God. Prayer is also very intentional and a rhythm of it in the morning is special
* My body
    * Working out - We get one body and honing it to be strongth and capable of navigating the physical world is a joy, and a discipline that can carry to the mind
    * Nutrition - Giving the one body all the supplies it needs to be successful in a day and just building up it's nutrition is a great gift to give yourself and the causes and people you serve. This involves for me spring water, vegetables and my supplements in the morning
* Externalizing thoughts
    * I wake up with inherently just a lot of chaos in my brain. It feels like sleep just stirs in me a complete shift in my brain usually, so I will wake up with all kinds of thoughts and feelings that seem to come from nowhere. Sometimes they are very helpful but most of the time they just aren't. Literally talking them out and just putting them on the table first thing in the morning just helps me look at them, and then usually move on from them. This is just a step of getting the unexpected out of the way, or making it fully conscious when first starting the day. this goes hand in hand with prayer, but sometimes I just need to take a tangeant and just ramble and look at whatever it is that came to the brain first thing in the morning


From these ideas I am building a morning routine. It is important that the "Why" makes sense to me, so having these priorities is key. Then deciding what to do and the timing becomes very easy. I think I want to avoid just sticking to a structure that is too rigid for right now, so that I can be working on all these things, but allow myself to experiment with different days. That being said, by making every single choice and preparing for it the night before, we avoid decision-making fatigue the next morning, and we can just get up and rock and roll.
